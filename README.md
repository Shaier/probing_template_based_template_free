## Code 

Code will be added soon! Stay tuned. 

## LIPID Dataset 

In the meantime, we provide the LIPID dataset (tempLate-free bIomedical ProbIng Dataset), a collection of 88,666 template-free prompts from PubMed abstracts. 

The dataset is split into two portions: chemicals and genes. 

* Chemicals: 46,827 chemical-related prompts and 1870 unique chemical entities 

* Genes: 41,839 gene-related prompts and 2591 unique gene entities
